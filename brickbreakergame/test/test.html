    <h2 >In the year 2050, a group of aliens from a distant planet called Zorgon invaded Earth with the intention of enslaving humanity. </h2>
    <br>
    <h2 > The aliens had a powerful weapon that could turn any material into bricks, and they used it to build an impenetrable fortress around the White House in Washington D.C.</h2>
    <h2>The world's leaders, including the President of the United States, were taken hostage by the aliens, who demanded that humanity surrender to them or face annihilation. How ever, one brave individual, a former US Marine named John Brick, decided to take matters into his own hands.</h2>
    <h2> He built a specialized brick-breaking machine, which he named the "Brickinator," and set out to liberate the White House and save the world.</h2>
    <h2>As John Brick navigates through the various levels of the game, he encounters different US Presidents who have been trapped by the aliens and forced to work as slave laborers.</h2>
    <h2>With each level, John Brick frees a new President and gains valuable information on the aliens' plans and weaknesses.</h2>
    <h2>Finally, in the climactic final level, John Brick reaches the heart of the alien fortress and confronts their leader, a massive alien queen who has been controlling the invasion from behind the scenes. </h2>
    <h2> Using his Brickinator, John Brick breaks through the alien queen's defenses and defeats her, freeing the world from her tyranny and restoring peace to Earth.</h2>
    <h2>As a reward for his heroism, John Brick is hailed as a national hero and receives the Medal of Honor from the President of the United States. </h2>
    <h2>From that day forward, the Brickinator becomes a symbol of hope and courage for all humanity, reminding us that even in the darkest of times, one person can make a difference. </h2>
